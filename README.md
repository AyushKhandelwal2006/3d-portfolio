Hello,
I am **Ayush Khandelwal**, an undergraduate student from the **Information Technology** branch. I designed a modern, interactive portfolio website built with a focus on clean UI, smooth animations, and performance-aware 3D elements.

## Features

- Interactive 3D hero section using React Three Fiber
- Project cards 
- Smooth UI animations using Framer Motion
- Fully responsive layout across desktop and mobile
- Graceful fallback for low-power devices (3D disabled on smaller screens)
- Clean, minimal design using Tailwind CSS
- Direct contact options via external links (github,linkdin,email)

## Tech Stack

- Next.js
- React
- Tailwind CSS
- React Three Fiber / Drei
